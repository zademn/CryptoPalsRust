# CryptoPalsRust
(ongoing)

Halo, zademn here. 

These are my implementations for the CryptoPals challenges in Rust. I took the challenges in order to learn the Rust programming language. 

The project is structured as follows
- each set has a `cargo` project
- each challenge has a file.
- each file has a `challenge()` function for the challenge. - This function is called in `main.rs`
- `main.rs` has commented lines that call the `challenge()` functions

The `utils` cargo project is for utils such as conversions or random number generators

## Enjoy!
