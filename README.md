# CryptoPalsRust
(ongoing)

Halo, zademn here. 

These are my implementations of the CryptoPals challenges in Rust. I took the challenges in order to learn the Rust programming language. 

The project is structured as follows
- each set has a `cargo` project
- each challenge has a file.
- each file has a `challenge()` function for the challenge and the solution in it
- call the challenges with `cargo run --bin runner <challenge_number>`

The `utils` cargo project is for utils such as conversions or random number generators
The `runner` is to run the challenges

## Enjoy!
